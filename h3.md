# Week 3- My first hacking lab

## Reading Task Summaries

### Karvinen 2021: Install Debian on VirtualBox
- Step-by-step guide for setting up Debian inside a VM.
- Set VM with enough RAM and big virtual disk 
- Download ISO, attach to VM, configure RAM/disk, then install.   
- Run the installer and choose language as finnish and did the whole process
- After installed, update everything through terminal.


**My Notes:**  
- On my Mac, I had to use the ARM64 ISO.  
- I chose 4 GB RAM and 60 GB disk, which runs fine in UTM.  
- UTM worked more smoothly and friend and teacher helps me to get this virtual workspace.  
- This gave me a clean and isolated Debian to experiment with.
- After completed the whole process, the same process was happening as a loop and i deleted the one file and now it worked fine.

### Karvinen 2020: Command Line Basics Revisited
- Command line enables automation, reproducibility, and flexibility.  
- Introduces ls, cd, cp, mv, chmod, grep, and piping |.  
- Teaches file redirection >, >>.  
- Emphasizes manuals: man <command>.  

**Idea:** I should start logging all new commands into my personal cheat sheet.  

### Karvinen 2020: Command Line Basics Revisited
- Command line has been around longer than the Internet – still fast and useful today.
- pwd, ls, cd → move around the system.
- nano, mkdir, mv, cp, rm → create, edit, copy and delete files.
- ssh and scp → connect to remote computers and move files.
- man and --help → get help.
- history, Ctrl+R, and Tab → find and complete commands quickly.
- /home, /etc, /var/log → key directories to remember.
- sudo → run admin commands, needed for installs with apt-get.

My note: Tab-completion is really handy, but I’m still a bit nervous about using sudo rm -r in case I remove the wrong thing.

## a) Can't Fish
Disable networking and show that packets don't go trough.
- Successfully disabled the network by configuring the UTM VM mode to "Host Only" whish is to restrict the external network access.
- I used the command below to test connection to DNS cloudflare

  ```bash
  ping 1.1.1.1

- It shows "ping: connect: Network is unreachable"

## b) Host only
- Throughout the scan the network was in "Host Only" mode.
- i installed the nmap using the command below.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install nmap
   ```
  - i use the command, it asked me the password and i put the correct password but it says "pawan is not in the sudoers file."
  - so i tried using the root directly by using below command
    ```bash
    su -
    ```
  - then I enter the root password and installed the nmap, it asks me to continue and say y and it started installing but it asked for 28 gb space but I have just 22 gb there so it couldnot get install and i am stuck here.

- for port scan, I used this:

  ```bash
  sudo nmap -A localhost
  ```
  - here it says command not found.

  ## c)Daemon scan
  For this scan i tried the OpenSSH server:
- OpenSSH is the standard program for secure remote login on Linux.
- It runs as a daemon (sshd) and listens on port 22/tcp.
- Once installed and started, nmap will show port 22 as open and identify the service as OpenSSH.
- This means other computers could connect to the VM using SSH (if network is enabled).
- It’s useful for administration, but also a common attack target, so it must be protected with strong passwords or keys.
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install -y openssh-server
  sudo systemctl start ssh
  ```
- becauseof my above error i couldnot complete this scan also.



### I will complete my whole part after i solve this problems asking the teacher.
